# 🎲 Dadaist Poem Generator

A playful web-based generator that transforms any input text into a surreal, Dada-style poem using randomized word arrangements. Inspired by the original cut-up method proposed by Tristan Tzara in 1920. This project also draws direct influence from the work of Prof. Thomas Blum of La Salle University, whose earlier implementation can be explored [here](http://www1.lasalle.edu/~blum/c340wks/DadaPoem.htm).

Additional features rooted in Dadaism, computational creativity, and text mining are planned for future development.

## ✨ Features

- 🖋️ Input any text and generate a Dadaist poem
- 🔀 Two modes: **CHAOS** (line-based shuffle) and **FULL CHAOS** (total randomization)
- 📋 Copy generated poem to clipboard with a single click
- 🎨 Minimalist dark-themed UI with responsive layout
- ⚡ Built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)

## 🧠 How It Works

The tool randomly rearranges words from the input to simulate the Dada cut-up poetry technique. In *CHAOS* mode, the structure is partially preserved by shuffling within lines. In *FULL CHAOS* mode, the words are entirely randomized across the whole input.
